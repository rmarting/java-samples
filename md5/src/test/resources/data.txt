The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash function producing a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value, typically expressed in text format as a 32 digit hexadecimal number. MD5 has been utilized in a wide variety of cryptographic applications, and is also commonly used to verify data integrity.

MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function, MD4.[3] The source code in RFC 1321 contains a "by attribution" RSA license.

In 1996 a flaw was found in the design of MD5. While it was not deemed a fatal weakness at the time, cryptographers began recommending the use of other algorithms, such as SHA-1-which has since been found to be vulnerable as well.[4] In 2004 it was shown that MD5 is not collision resistant.[5] As such, MD5 is not suitable for applications like SSL certificates or digital signatures that rely on this property for digital security. Also in 2004 more serious flaws were discovered in MD5, making further use of the algorithm for security purposes questionable; specifically, a group of researchers described how to create a pair of files that share the same MD5 checksum.[6][7] Further advances were made in breaking MD5 in 2005, 2006, and 2007.[8] In December 2008, a group of researchers used this technique to fake SSL certificate validity,[9][10] and CMU Software Engineering Institute now says that MD5 "should be considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use",[11] and most U.S. government applications now require the SHA-2 family of hash functions.[12] In 2012, the Flame malware exploited the weaknesses in MD5 to fake a Microsoft digital signature.
